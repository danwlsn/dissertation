This dissertation will cover the whole process behind the building of the progress monitoring web application. The application will allow a user to track their current and goal weight, goals, and fitness log. The application will focus on these three main points and not distract the user away from their progress with other features, such as social media sharing. While some may argue that people want to share their progress with their friends on social media, this application focuses on the user and the user alone. More information on these choices can be found in the design section of the paper. The literature review chapter will focus on current fitness progress monitor application that are already available for use. It will discuss both the good and bad points about each application and what this application will do differently. The design chapter will also cover the reasoning behind most of the design choices that were made during the planning of this application. For example, which font was chosen and why. After that, the development chapter will talk through the development process. It will go into detail about which tools were used and why, the problems and challenges that were faced during development and how they were over come, and also deployment of the web application to the internet.
